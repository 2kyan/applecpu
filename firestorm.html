</pre><p>This is an early attempt at microarchitecture documentation for the CPU in the Apple M1, inspired by and building on the amazing work of <a href="https://uops.info/">Andreas Abel</a>,
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive/2">Andrei Frumusanu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Veedrac/microarchitecturometer">@Veedrac</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/robsize">Travis Downs</a>, <a href="http://blog.stuffedcow.net/2013/05/measuring-rob-capacity/">Henry Wong</a>
and <a href="https://agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog</a>. This documentation is my best effort, but it is based on black-box reverse engineering, and there are definitely mistakes. No warranty of any kind (and not just as a legal technicality). To make it easier to verify the information and/or identify such errors, entries in the instruction tables link to the experiments and results (~35k tables of counter values).</p>


<p>Firestorm is the high-performance microarchitecture used by the four P-cores in the M1.</p>

<h2>Firestorm Units (ports)</h2>

<p>These are refered to as "units", to try to avoid confusion if Apple releases official documentation, as they
probably refer to them as "ports" or "pipes", and order them differently. (If this just causes more confusion,
I apologise.)</p>

<pre>
Integer units:

  1:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv + mrs
  2:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv
  3:  alu + flags + mov-from-simd/fp?
  4:  alu + mov-from-simd/fp?
  5:  alu + mul + div
  6:  alu + mul + madd + crc + bfm/extr

Load and store units (up to 128-bit loads and stores, including address generation with shifts up to LSL #3):

  7:  store + amx
  8:  load/store + amx
  9:  load
  10: load

FP/SIMD units:

  11: fp/simd
  12: fp/simd
  13: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr
  14: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr + fcmp/e + fdiv + frecpe + frsqrte + fjcvtzs + ursqrte + urecpe + sha
</pre>


<h2>Instruction Fusion</h2>

<p>Certain instructions are able to issue as one uop if they appear consecutively in the instruction stream.</p>

<ul>
<li>adds/subs/ands/cmp/tst + b.cc (complete fusion when fused instructions read no more than 4 registers per 6 instructions)</li>
<li>aese + aesmc (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li>aesd + aesimc (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li>pmull + eor (usually fused if operands match pattern "A, B, C ; A, A, D" or "A, B, C ; A, D, A")</li>
<li>amx + amx (excluding loads and stores - probably fuses to something like a STP)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Elimination</h2>

<p>Certain instructions do not need to issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>mov x0, 0 (handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov x0, x1 (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li>movi v0.16b, #0 (handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov v0.16b, v1.16b (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov imm/movz/movn (handled by renamer at a max of 2 per 8 instructions, includes all tested "mov")</li>
<li>nop (never issues)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Complex Latencies</h2>

<p>Several instructions have latencies that aren't adequately described in the instruction tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>MADD's output can be passed to its third operand (the addend) with 1c latency, but if it's chained with other instructions it has 3c latency.</li>
<li>Loads may be passed to the base address of other loads with 3c latency (which is nice for linked lists), but chaining with out ALU operations gives a latency of 4c. (Although the second destination register in an LDP always has 4c latency.)</li>
<li>Integer to SIMD/FP roundtrip latency can be as low as 7c (e.g. when chaining flags operations).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other limits</h2>

<p>Firestorm can retire eight instructions per cycle, but can issue more uops (using implicit shifts or extends on ALU operations, as thus far other uops retire separately).</p>

<ul>
<li>Retires per cycle: 8</li>
<li>ROB (in-flight renames): ~623</li>
<li>Integer physical register file size: ~380</li>
<li>FP/SIMD physical register file size: ~434</li>
<li>Fetch window tracking slots (in-flight I-cache lines or branches): ~144</li>
<li>Load buffers: ~129</li>
<li>Store buffers: ~108</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers mostly come from the <a href="https://gist.github.com/dougallj/5bafb113492047c865c0c8cfbc930155">M1 buffer size measuring tool</a>.
The M1 seems to use something along the lines of a validation buffer, rather than a conventional reorder buffer, which
complicates measurements a bit. So these may or may not be accurate.</p>
