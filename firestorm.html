</pre><p>This is an early attempt at microarchitecture documentation for the CPU in the Apple M1, inspired by and building on the amazing work of <a href="https://uops.info/">Andreas Abel</a>,
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive/2">Andrei Frumusanu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Veedrac/microarchitecturometer">@Veedrac</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/robsize">Travis Downs</a>, <a href="http://blog.stuffedcow.net/2013/05/measuring-rob-capacity/">Henry Wong</a>
and <a href="https://agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog</a>. This documentation is my best effort, but it is based on black-box reverse engineering, and there are definitely mistakes. No warranty of any kind (and not just as a legal technicality). To make it easier to verify the information and/or identify such errors, entries in the instruction tables link to the experiments and results (~35k tables of counter values).</p>


<p>Firestorm is the high-performance microarchitecture used by the four P-cores in the M1.</p>

<h2>Firestorm Units (ports)</h2>

<p>These are refered to as "units", to try to avoid confusion if Apple releases official documentation, as they
probably refer to them as "ports" or "pipes", and order them differently. (If this just causes more confusion,
I apologise.)</p>

<pre>
Integer units:

  1:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv + mrs
  2:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv + ptrauth
  3:  alu + flags + mov-from-simd/fp?
  4:  alu + mov-from-simd/fp?
  5:  alu + mul + div
  6:  alu + mul + madd + crc + bfm/extr

Load and store units (up to 128-bit loads and stores, including address generation with shifts up to LSL #3):

  7:  store + amx
  8:  load/store + amx
  9:  load
  10: load

FP/SIMD units:

  11: fp/simd
  12: fp/simd
  13: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr
  14: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr + fcmp/e + fdiv + frecpe + frsqrte + fjcvtzs + ursqrte + urecpe + sha
</pre>


<h2>Instruction Fusion</h2>

<p>Certain instructions are able to issue as one uop if they appear consecutively in the instruction stream.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>adds</code>/<code>subs</code>/<code>ands</code>/<code>cmp</code>/<code>tst</code> + <code>b.cc</code> (complete fusion when fused instructions read no more than 4 registers per 6 instructions)</li>
<li><code>add</code>/<code>sub</code>/<code>and</code>/<code>orr</code>/<code>eor</code>/<code>bic</code>/etc. + <code>cbnz</code>/<code>cbz</code> (usually fused, if destination matches cbz operand. also works with instruction variants that set flags)</li>
<li><code>aese</code> + <code>aesmc</code> (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li><code>aesd</code> + <code>aesimc</code> (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li><code>pmull</code> + <code>eor</code> (usually fused if operands match pattern "A, B, C ; A, A, D" or "A, B, C ; A, D, A")</li>
<li><code>amx</code> + <code>amx</code> (excluding loads and stores - probably fuses to something like a <code>stp</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Branch fusion does not work with implicit shift or extend, nor instructions that read flags (like <code>adc</code>)</p>

<p>Other tested patterns are <strong>not</strong> fused, including <code>adrp</code> + <code>add</code>, and <code>mov</code> + <code>movk</code>.</p>


<h2>Elimination</h2>

<p>Certain instructions do not need to issue:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mov x0, #0</code> (handled by renaming)</li>
<li><code>mov x0, x1</code> (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li><code>movi v0.16b, #0</code> (handled by renaming)</li>
<li><code>mov v0.16b, v1.16b</code> (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li><code>mov x0, #123</code> (handled by renamer at a max of 2 per 8 instructions, includes all tested immediate "mov" aliases e.g. bitwise/movz/movn)</li>
<li><code>nop</code> (never issues)</li>
<li><code>b</code> (unconditional branch never issues)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other tested instructions are <strong>not</strong> eliminated, including <code>adr</code>/<code>adrp</code>, and <code>mov x0, xzr</code>.</p>

<h2>Complex Latencies</h2>

<p>Several instructions have latencies that aren't adequately described in the instruction tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>MADD's output can be passed to its third operand (the addend) with 1c latency, but if it's chained with other instructions it has 3c latency.</li>
<li>Loads may be passed to the base address of other loads with 3c latency (which is nice for linked lists), but chaining with ALU operations gives a latency of 4c. (Although the second destination register in an LDP always has 4c latency.)</li>
<li>Integer to SIMD/FP roundtrip latency can be as low as 7c (e.g. when chaining flags operations).</li>
<li>Not yet in the table: pointer authentication uops have seven cycle latency, one cycle throughput. They are one uop (except for memory operations).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other limits</h2>

<p>Firestorm can retire eight instructions per cycle, but can issue more uops (using implicit shifts or extends on ALU operations, as thus far other uops retire separately).</p>

<ul>
<li>"Retires" (uops that retire) per cycle: 8</li>
<li>ROB (in-flight renames): ~623</li>
<li>Integer physical register file size: ~380</li>
<li>FP/SIMD physical register file size: ~434</li>
<li>Fetch window tracking slots (in-flight I-cache lines or branches): ~144</li>
<li>In-flight loads: ~129</li>
<li>In-flight stores: ~108</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers mostly come from my <a href="https://gist.github.com/dougallj/5bafb113492047c865c0c8cfbc930155">M1 buffer size measuring tool</a>.
The M1 seems to use something other than an entirely conventional reorder buffer, which
complicates measurements a bit. So these may or may not be accurate.
(This paragraph previously said "it seems to use something along the lines of a validation buffer".
I think the VB hypothesis has since been disproven. Various attempts to measure ROB size
have yielded values 623, 853, and 2295 (see the previous link). My uninformed hypothesis
is that this may imply a kind of distributed reorder buffer, where only structures that
need to know about a given operation track them, and/or some kind of out-of-order retirement.)
</p>


<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>
As instructions are executed, they are mapped to operations inside the processor.
This work describes two kinds, "operations that retire" (which I call "retires",
but should maybe be called "retirement slots"), and "operations that issue" (uops).
Operations that issue are limited by how many ports are available that can execute
that operation in a given cycle. Retirement slots are limited to eight per cycle,
which I have called the "retires per cycle" limit, but likely corresponds to a
frontend "decode width", rather than a limit related to retirement itself
(which I suspect could be either out-of-order, or much wider). All instructions
have at least one retire, but some instructions have more uops than retires
(e.g. ADD (shift)), and others have fewer (e.g. NOP, LDP).
</p>


<p>
These two types of operations can be measured, using the retire counter (counter 01,
undocumented, shown in the <strong>Retire</strong> column in the tables), and the
issue counter (counter 52, documented). The following three undocumented counters
(53, 54, and 55) count the same kind of uops as the issue counter, but at a different
point in the pipeline. These correspond to the <strong>Int</strong>, <strong>Mem</strong>
and <strong>FP</strong> columns in the tables, and count uops that issues to units of
the given type.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the <strong>Units</strong> column is based on finding conflicts when measuring
throughput - if two uops block each other, we can tell they both use the same unit.
(Unfortunately these experiments are not yet automated nor included in the documentation,
so there may be some mistakes.)
